# Linear models


#### Introduction


TODO: explain computation
TODO: explain regularization methods and the coarse-to-fine tuning


#### Examples


TODO: training (iterator, dataset, loss, solver)
TODO: model loading and saving


#### Future work

* Extend benchmark to using stochastic solvers for faster training
* Extend benchmark to export training results to files
* Generate plots (using gnuplot) to compare various configurations (e.g. solvers, regularization methods, features)
