# Linear models


#### Introduction


TODO: explain computation, regularization methods (ridge, elasticnet, lasso, variance)

TODO: scaling methods of the flatten inputs & targets

TODO: tuning methods


#### Examples


TODO: example source code on small benchmark dataset

TODO: show how to load the dataset, create the feature generators and train the model

TODO: show how to evaluate the model using nested cross-validation

TODO: model loading and saving


#### Future work

* Extend benchmark to using stochastic solvers for faster training
* Extend benchmark to export training results to files
* Generate plots (using gnuplot) to compare various configurations (e.g. solvers, regularization methods, scaling methods, features)
* Support for non-parametric statistical testing
